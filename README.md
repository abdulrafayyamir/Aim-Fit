# Aim Fit

# INTRODUCTION:
In this project we have mainly used the kivymd platform to create an effective application which is basically a fitness app. 


# OBJECTIVE:
In this project we will take a series of information from the user such as their respective height and weight followed by their fitness goal. It will also ask the user for their age to determine an accurate diet according to the bodily requirements of that user. Then it will also recommend an appropriate diet and workout regime to the user.
# METHODOLOGY:

# BACKEND:
•	In this project we made use of different concepts of object-oriented programming such as inheritance, multiple inheritance, instance method, classes, objects static method, exception handling, global variable, instance variable, global functions and import function, (binding functions of kivy)

#FRONTEND:
•	We have used the concepts of material designing by using kivymd which provides very user friendly and smooth graphical user interface. Using kivymd was a step into the frontend world which really helped us as developers and will also be appreciated by the user when interacted with

•	Firstly, we imported various modules of kivymd as shown below:
 

•	We created two global functions that will act as pop up errors incase of an invalid entry.

•	We created two screens which are login and account which will basically manage the account.

•	Now the main home screen and the about us screen is all created/ based on only gui(kivymd), transition between different pages is also done through gui

•	In the BMI (Body Mass Index) screen we use different concepts of oop for example multiple inheritance. One parent class of kivy and the second parent class named as “info” which basically provides different methods that is to be executed accordingly with the conditions that are given in the BMI class. We have also used a bit of exception handling that helps us in writing a shorter, more effective code as a lot of conditions are not to be specified.

•	The rest of the screens are gui based also, all the transitions between different screens and throughout the entire application is achieved through different modules and functionalities of kivymd.
